### Live, Laugh, Lager

This was the first full stack application I built post bootcamp.  The app works, but the code is not pretty.  Components are not in logical orders, syntax isn't great, and there is no readability.  I am slowly going back over the codebase to rewrite it.

Live, Laugh, Lager is a beer review app that allows users to review beers, add beer related posts, and find breweries near them. I always found it incredibly frustrating as a brewer that other beer rating apps only required an overall rating for a beer score.  It led to drinkers rating beer without any criteria which led to meaningless ratings.  So I require a user to rate 4 critera and the app creates the overall score.  It uses a third party API and reviews and posts have all CRUD actions.
